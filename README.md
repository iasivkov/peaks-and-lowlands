# peaks-and-lowlands
Python realization of the lowlands algorithm for multimodality detection, based on quantile-respectful density estimation.

The algorithm was proposed by Andrey Akinshin. See for more details: https://aakinshin.net/posts/lowland-multimodality-detection/

## Using examples

For using examples see documentaion section "Examples", example_script.py and example_notebook.ipynb
